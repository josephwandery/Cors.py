Cors.py tool is a lightweight program designed to scan for all known misconfigurations in CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) implementations. The tool introduces an enhanced version of the Corsy tool that can check for CORS misconfigurations. This version supports both single URLs and a list of URLs from a text file.
This tool checks if the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is set to * or reflects the origin, which are common CORS misconfigurations.
